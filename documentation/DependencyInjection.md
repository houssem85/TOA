# Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is important to ensure that our code be easily tested and dependencies can be
changed seamlessly without heavily impacting our application code.

This project uses
the [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) dependency
injection library because it is Google's official recommendation for dependency injection.

You can reference the docs linked above to get started if you are unfamiliar with it.
